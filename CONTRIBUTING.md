## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep files focused and small
- Use proper TypeScript types

## Component Guidelines

1. **Structure**
   - One component per file
   - Export as default
   - Keep components focused
   - Use TypeScript interfaces

2. **Styling**
   - Use Tailwind CSS
   - Follow responsive design patterns
   - Maintain consistency with existing UI

3. **State Management**
   - Use hooks appropriately

   - Handle errors gracefully

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if needed
